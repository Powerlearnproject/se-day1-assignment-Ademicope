# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

=> Software engineering is the process aof applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It involves product design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance. Software engineering is very important in the technoogy industry as it powers various aspects of modern life including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

=> Key milestones in the evolution of software engineering are: the establishment of sofware engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming, and the rise of agile methodologies characterised by constant iteration throught the developement processes.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

=> 1. Requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
   2. Design: Creating hight-level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface
   3. Implementation: writing code and building the software according to design specification
   4. Testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
   5. Deployment: releasing the software to users
   6. Maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
=> Waterfall methodology involves a sequential aproach with distinct phases while agiile is more iterative and focused on flexibility, collaboration and response to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

=> A software developer writes code and implements software solutions
   A quality assurance engineer ensures the quality of a sofware system by designing and executing test plans.
   A project manager oversses the planning, executing and delivery of the software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

=> IDEs are very important in the software development process as they provide the neccessary tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Examples are Vscode, eclipse.
=> VCS helps in tracking and managing changes in codes during development. Examples are Github, gitlab


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

=> Challenges faced by software engineers include: CHanging requirements,  tight deadlines, technical debts
=> strategies to overcome these challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, tasks prioritisation and regular assessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

=> unit testing is testing individual unit or modules of a software
=> integration testing tests the interaction between module or subsystems of software
=> system testing tests the entire software system as a whole
=> acceptance testing tests the software against user requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

=> Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions and instructions that hellps to get the best reponses from AI models


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

=> prompt: write a song
=> improved prompt: write a love song in french
